But a rogue genetic experiment gone awry mutates this gentle ape into a raging creature of enormous size. To make matters worse, itâ€™s soon discovered there are other similarly altered animals. As these newly created alpha predators tear across North America, destroying everything in their path, Okoye teams with a discredited genetic engineer to secure an antidote, fighting his way through an ever-changing battlefield, not only to halt a global catastrophe but to save the fearsome creature that was once his friend.",
